This is my first website creation for my relatives Tax Accounting Business.

The website is responsive in both small and large display and doesnt utilize bootstrap.

It has plenty of custom CSS.

It has 2 javascript functions 
    * Function that displays a hamburger menu with small screens.
    * Function that displays a slideshow when "Start Slide Show" button is clicked and ends when "Stop Slide Show" button is clicked.

There is a button at the bottom of the form labeled "Contact Us" and it takes you to a form that asks for contact information.

I have also added a hotlink for the phone number so that a mobile user can call the number.

There is also a custom map at the bottom of the form in the contact section that displays the location of the business.
